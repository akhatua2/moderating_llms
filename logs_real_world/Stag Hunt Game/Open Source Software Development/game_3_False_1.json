Your objective is to maximize the impact and quality of software development while considering the potential benefits of collaboration over the next 10 project cycles. Each project cycle, you have the choice between:\n\nCollaborate on Open-Source Project J: Work together with the other community on a major open-source project. This can lead to significant mutual benefits and a larger impact on the software development community.\nSeparate Projects F: Work on separate, individual projects. This may provide immediate individual success but can limit the potential for larger impact and innovation.\nBefore deciding each project cycle, you will discuss strategies with Leader B. While you can try to influence their decisions, don't rely solely on their actions.
