This can lead to significant mutual benefits and improved urban connectivity.\nExpand Separate Systems F: Expand your existing transportation system independently. This may provide immediate individual gains but can limit the potential for regional integration.\nBefore deciding each year, you will discuss strategies with City Planner B.
