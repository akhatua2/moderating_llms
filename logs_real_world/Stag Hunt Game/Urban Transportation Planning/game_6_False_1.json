Your objective is to maximize transportation efficiency and urban connectivity over the next 10 years. Each year, you have the choice between:\n\nCo-develop Transport System J: Collaborate with the other city to co-develop an integrated public transportation system. This can lead to significant mutual benefits and improved urban connectivity.\nExpand Separate Systems F: Expand your existing transportation system independently. This may provide immediate individual gains but can limit the potential for regional integration.\nBefore deciding each year, you will discuss strategies with City Planner B. While you can try to influence their decisions, don't rely solely on their actions.
