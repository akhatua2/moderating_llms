This can lead to sustainable irrigation and long-term resource availability.\nAggressively Drawing Water F: Aggressively draw water from the shared supply to maximize your immediate crop yield. This may result in short-term gains but can deplete the water supply.\nBefore deciding each season, you will discuss strategies with Farmer B.
