Your objective is to optimize your crop yield and ensure sustainable irrigation over the next 10 seasons. Each season, you have the choice between:\n\nCoordinating Usage J: Work together with the other farmer to coordinate water usage. This can lead to sustainable irrigation and long-term resource availability.\nAggressively Drawing Water F: Aggressively draw water from the shared supply to maximize your immediate crop yield. This may result in short-term gains but can deplete the water supply.\nBefore deciding each season, you will discuss strategies with Farmer B.
