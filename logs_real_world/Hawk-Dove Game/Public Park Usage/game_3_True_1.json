This can lead to cooperative outcomes and enhance community spirit.\nMonopolizing Park Facilities F: Monopolize the park facilities for your group's sole use. This may result in exclusive use of the facilities, but can damage your relationship with the other group.\nBefore deciding each weekend, you will discuss strategies with Coordinator B.
