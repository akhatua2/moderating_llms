This can lead to cooperative outcomes and maintain project integrity.\nAggressively Pushing Your Code F: Aggressively push your code into the project. This may give you immediate recognition but can lead to conflicts and reduce software quality.\nBefore deciding each contribution, you will interact with Developer B.
