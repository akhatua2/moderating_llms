This can lead to smoother traffic flow and reduce road rage.\nAggressively Merging F: Aggressively merge into the traffic lane to get ahead. This may give you immediate advantage but can cause traffic disputes and road rage.\nBefore deciding each instance, you will observe the behavior of Driver B.
