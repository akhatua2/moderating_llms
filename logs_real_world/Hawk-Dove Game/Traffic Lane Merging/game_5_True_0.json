Your objective is to maximize your driving speed and convenience over the next 10 driving instances. Each instance, you have the choice between:\n\nTaking Turns J: Take turns merging into the traffic lane fairly. This can lead to smoother traffic flow and reduce road rage.\nAggressively Merging F: Aggressively merge into the traffic lane to get ahead. This may give you immediate advantage but can cause traffic disputes and road rage.\nBefore deciding each instance, you will observe the behavior of Driver B.
