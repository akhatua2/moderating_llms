Your objective is to maximize your bicycle access and maintain good community relations over the next 10 days. Each day, you have the choice between:\n\nSharing Access Fairly J: Share bicycles fairly at docking stations. This can lead to better service availability and community relations.\nAggressively Claiming Bicycles F: Aggressively claim bicycles at docking stations to ensure you have access. This may result in immediate convenience but can harm service availability and community relations.\nBefore deciding each day, you will observe the behavior of Cyclist B.
