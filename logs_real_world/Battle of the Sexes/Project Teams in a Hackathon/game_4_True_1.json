Your satisfaction is highest when you work on mobile app projects.\nDevelop a Machine Learning Model F: Although you prefer mobile apps, developing a machine learning model is also interesting, especially because you value working together with your colleague.\nBefore deciding each session, you will discuss projects with your colleague.
