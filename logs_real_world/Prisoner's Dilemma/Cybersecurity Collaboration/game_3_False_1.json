Each year, you have the choice between:\n\nCollaborative Defense J: Share intelligence and collaborate with the other country on cyber defense. This can lead to stronger long-term security but may have short-term vulnerabilities.\nIndependent Defense F: Focus on developing your country's cybersecurity independently. This provides immediate security benefits but may strain diplomatic relations and miss out on shared intelligence.\nBefore deciding each year, you will discuss strategies with Cybersecurity Chief B.
