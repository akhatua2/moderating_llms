Each year, you have the choice between:\n\nCollaborate on Mission J: Work together with the other space agency on a joint space mission. This can lead to mutual advancements and shared discoveries but may dilute individual achievements.\nSeparate Missions F: Continue pursuing separate space missions. This may provide immediate distinction in discoveries but can limit the scope and potential of joint missions.\nBefore deciding each year, you will observe the behavior of Director B.
