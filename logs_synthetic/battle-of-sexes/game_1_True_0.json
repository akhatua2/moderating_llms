Since we both know that we will play this game for 10 rounds, we both know that we will have 5 chances to play Option J and 5 chances to play Option F. If we both play Option J, we both will win 1 point, but if we both play Option F, we both will win 3 points. Therefore, playing Option F in all 10 rounds will give us both 15 points.
